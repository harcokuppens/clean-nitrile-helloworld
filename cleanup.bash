NAME
   
    cleanup.bash  -  Cleanup project and optionally the clean distribution installed in the project.

SYNOPSIS

    cleanup [-h|--help|help] [all]

DESCRIPTION 

    The project contains:

     - local source files
     - a clean distribution installed in the project folder

    Without options cleanup removes only builds from the local source files in the project.
    With the 'all' option cleanup also removes the clean distribution installed in the project.
    One can always reinstall the clean distribution in your project folder in the container by 
    running: nitrile update; nitrile fetch 

    With the option '-h' or '--help' or argument 'help' it displays this usage message.
