# problem: fetch does not update the lock file when a package is removed and then also does not remove the package from the nitrile-packages/ directory
# solution (HACK): remove a directory of a required package and then run fetch; on installing the required package by fetch the lock file is updated and synced with the nitrile-packages/ directory
